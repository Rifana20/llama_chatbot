# 🦙 TinyLLaMA Chatbot

A beginner-friendly chatbot using Meta’s TinyLLaMA model, Streamlit, and Hugging Face 🤖  
This project allows you to chat with a small, efficient open-source language model using a clean web interface.
his project is a simple and beginner-friendly AI chatbot built using Meta’s TinyLLaMA language model and Streamlit. It leverages Hugging Face’s transformers library to load and run a lightweight open-source model locally, making it a great starting point for understanding how language models work in real-time applications. The chatbot takes user input, processes it with the TinyLLaMA model, and responds naturally through a clean and interactive web interface. Ideal for students, developers, and hobbyists who want to explore LLMs without needing heavy computing resources.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The app loads the TinyLLaMA model and tokenizer from Hugging Face.
2. You enter a question or prompt via a simple Streamlit UI.
3. The model processes the input and generates a natural language response.
4. The chatbot shows the response in the browser.
